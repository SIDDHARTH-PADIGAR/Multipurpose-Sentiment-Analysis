# Multipurpose Sentiment AnalysisA fully end-to-end sentiment analysis toolkit and API, built using HuggingFace Transformers, offering robust and extensible sentiment classification capabilities for real-world applications.

## Project Overview**Multipurpose-Sentiment-Analysis** is an advanced sentiment analysis solution leveraging state-of-the-art transformer architectures to classify text sentiment with high accuracy. This project is designed for experimentation, deployment, and integration, providing a clean, production-ready codebase.

It supports training and fine-tuning on custom datasets, and offers a RESTful API for seamless inference.

## Real-World ApplicationsThis toolkit addresses real, valuable challenges encountered by businesses and customers alike:

- **Product Review Monitoring & Automation:**  
  Analyze thousands of customer reviews instantly to automatically determine whether a product has a healthy ratio of positive to negative sentiments. This insight aids buyers in making informed purchasing decisions by surfacing products with strong positive feedback.
  
- **User-Centric Insights:**  
  Provide shoppers with real-time sentiment summaries to reduce purchase uncertainty, helping them understand if a product is well-liked.

- **Seller/Brand Advantages:**  
  Automate the otherwise intensive task of manually reviewing each customer feedback. The tool flags concerning sentiment trends and surfaces positive endorsements, enabling quicker response, better product improvements, and enhanced customer support efficiency.

## Features- **State-of-the-Art Transformers:** Easily switch or extend models such as BERT or DistilBERT from HuggingFace.
- **API Server Included:** Deployable FastAPI/Flask server (`api_server.py`) for real-time sentiment inference.
- **Custom Training Pipeline:** Modular code enabling training/fine-tuning on new datasets and labels.
- **Multipurpose Workflow:** Supports binary, multiclass, or custom sentiment classification.
- **Easy Deployment:** Pinpointed requirements and simple startup commands for hassle-free setup.
- **Extensible Design:** Add custom preprocessors, postprocessors, or swap models with minimal changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started### Dependencies- Python 3.7+
- HuggingFace Transformers
- PyTorch or TensorFlow backend
- FastAPI or Flask for API deployment
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install``` requirements```t
```

### Training & Fine-TuningModify `main.py` to specify dataset paths, model selection, and training hyperparameters, then run:
```bash
python```in.py
```

### Serving via APIStart the API server:
```bash
python api```rver.py
```

Send POST requests with text data to receive sentiment predictions in real time.

Example request:
```python
import requests```sponse = requests```st(
    "http://localhost```00/predict",
   ```on={"text": "```ove using Hug```gFace‚Äîsuch a```eat library```
)
print(response.json```   # Output```'label': '```itive', 'score': ```7}
```

## EvaluationThe project includes reproducible evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Check `main.py` for configurable options and logging details.

## Customization- Swap transformer models in `main.py` or `api_server.py` to try different HuggingFace architectures.
- Use your own datasets by adapting data loading to match your labels and format.
- Extend beyond sentiment analysis to tasks like emotion detection or topic classification.

## Technical WorkflowThe following Mermaid flowchart visually represents the typical workflow of the Multipurpose Sentiment Analysis project, from data loading through to real-world deployment and use:## üìÑ Documentation & Best Practices- Clean, readable, and modular code with inline comments and function docstrings.
- README and lightweight model card included for transparency.
- Designed for easy reuse and extension for other text classification tasks.
